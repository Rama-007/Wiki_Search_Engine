Have Stemmer installed in the system 
"sudo pip install pystemmer"

Output will be stored in .txt format

Techniques used :
1) Tokenization
2) CaseFolding
3) Stopword removal
4) Stemming : For stemming I first tried using nltk stemmer but there were errors in it and also it takes a lot of time in running so I shifter towards the porter stemmer in pystemmer.
5)Created inverted index and stored in this way:
	word:doc_id total_tf-idf_value t-title_tfvalue b-bodytext_tfvalue i-infobox_tfvalue c-category_tfvalue e-externallinks_tfvalue r-reference_tfvalue
6)Proper Optimisation is done and achieved an index size of 28MB for 128MB file.

## bash index.sh to create index
## and python fsearch.py to search
